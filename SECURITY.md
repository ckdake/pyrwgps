# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest version on the default branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability, please report it **privately** so I can investigate and address it.

### Preferred contact (private)
- **Email:** ckdake@ckdake.com

### Alternate contact
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/ckdake

### What to include
To help me triage quickly, please include:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept code or screenshots if helpful)
- Affected versions/branches/commits (if known)
- Any relevant logs, configuration, or stack traces (please redact secrets)
- Whether the issue can be exploited publicly or requires special access/conditions

### What to expect
- I’ll acknowledge receipt as soon as I can.
- I’ll investigate and work on a fix.
- Once a fix is available, I’ll publish an update and may note the issue in release notes or a changelog.

## Coordinated Disclosure

Please **do not** open a public GitHub issue, pull request, or discussion for security-related reports until I’ve confirmed it’s safe to do so.

If you have a suggested fix, you can:
1. Email the details first, and
2. Wait for confirmation before submitting a public PR.

## Scope

This policy applies to:
- The `pyrwgps` source code and build/release artifacts in this repository
- Documentation and configuration files in this repository

Third-party services and dependencies may have their own security policies; please report upstream issues to the relevant maintainers as well.
